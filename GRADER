Name of student running submit: Austin Chen
Login of student running submit: cs61b-ok

Second team member's name: Alec Mouri
Second team member's login: cs61b-ng

Third team member's name (if any): Michael Liu
Third team member's login: cs61b-jy

IMPORTANT:  Once you've submitted Project 2 once, the same team member should
submit always.  If a different teammate must submit, inform cs61b@cory.eecs of
all the details.  Include a complete list of team members, and let us know
which submission you want graded.

If you've submitted your project once, or even written a substantial amount of
code together, you may not change partners without the permission of the
instructor.
===============================================================================
Does your program compile without errors?
Yes, our program compiles without errors.

Have you tested your program on the machines in the Soda CS 61B lab?
Yes, our program has been tested in the Soda CS 61B lab machines.

Did you successfully implement game tree search?  Did you successfully
implement alpha-beta pruning?  Are there any limitations on it?  What is the
default number of search levels set by the one-parameter MachinePlayer
constructor?
Yes, we successfully implemented game tree search. Yes we successfully implemented
alpha-beta pruning. No limitations were placed on alpha-beta pruning unless
the depth is considered a limitation (search levels). The default number of search
levels set by the one-parameter MachinePlayer constructor is 2.

Describe your board evaluation function in some detail.
The board evaluation function returns a linear combination of the total number of
connected chips between pieces, the total number of possible moves, a measure of
the longest path length between both players, and a measure of central tendencies
the pieces have on the board.

Each of the quantities are given weights; the weights must add up to 1.

Does your MachinePlayer use any special method of choosing the first few moves?
For the first move, the MachinePlayer chooses (3,3) or (3,4) depending on the first 
avaliable move.

Is there anything else the graders should know to help them read your project?
Nothing.


Describe the classes, modules, and interfaces you designed before and while you
implemented the project.  Your description should include:
  -  A list of the classes your program uses.
  -  A list of each of the "modules" used in or by MachinePlayer, similar to
     the list in the "Teamwork" section of the README (but hopefully more
     detailed).
  -  For each module, list the class(es) the module is implemented in.
  -  For each module, say which of your team members implemented it.
  -  For each module, describe its interface--specifically, the prototype and
     behavior of each method that is available for external callers (outside
     the module) to call.  Don't include methods that are only meant to be
     called from within the module.

Modules:
Determining whether a move is valid (Board.java):
  /**
   * isValid() determines if a given move for a given player on this board
   * is valid.
   * 
   * @param color the turn of the current player (determined by color)
   * @param move the proposed move
   * @return if the proposed move is valid
   * 
   * @author Alec Mouri
   */
  public boolean isValid(int color, Move move)
    
Generating a list of all valid moves (Board.java):
  /**
   * allValidMoves() creates a list of all valid Moves for a given board and
   * player.
   * 
   * @param color the turn of the current player (determined by color)
   * @return
   * 
   * @author Michael Liu
   */
  public List allValidMoves(int color)
  
Finding the chips of the same color that share connections with a chip (Board.java):
  /**
   * connectedChips() creates a list of all chips which are connected to a
   * given chip on the board. Chips are represented by an int array of length
   * 2, in the form of {x, y}. If there is no chip at that location, return
   * an empty List.
   * 
   * @param chip the position of the chip to check for connections
   * @return a List of int arrays of chip positions
   * 
   * @author Austin Chen
   */
  public List connectedChips(int[] chip)
	
Determining whether a board state contains any networks (Board.java):
  /**
   * hasNetwork() checks to see if a board contains a winning network for a
   * given player.
   * 
   * @param color the turn of the current player (determined by color)
   * @param board the current state of the board
   * @return if there is a valid network
   * 
   * @author Alec Mouri
   */
  public boolean hasNetwork(int color)
  
Computing an evaluation function for the board (AI.java):
  /**
   * eval() analyzes the current board with respect to the current player 
   * for a given move returning a value between -Double.MAX_VALUE and Double.MAX_VALUE signifying
   * the strength of the given move.
   * 
   * @param color the turn of the current player (determined by color)
   * @param board the current state of the board
   * @return a double signifying the strength of a move
   * 
   * @author Alec Mouri, Austin Chen, Michael Liu
   */
  public static double eval(int color, Board board)
  
Performing a minimax search (AI.java):
  /**
   * bestMove() returns the strongest possible Move using our evaluation
   * function
   * 
   * @param color the turn of the current player (determined by color)
   * @param board the current state of the board
   * @param depth the depth to which eval() checks
   * @return an Object containing the strongest move and its corresponding strength
   * 
   * @author Michael Liu
   */
  public static Move bestMove(int color, Board board, int depth)
  
     For each method, provide (1) a method prototype and (2) a complete,
     unambiguous description of the behavior of the method/module.  This
     description should also appear before the method in your code's comments.

You will probably need to change some of your design decisions as you go; be
sure to modify this file to reflect these changes before you submit your
project.  Your design of classes and interfaces with be worth about 10% of your
grade.
